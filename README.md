# Home-Credit-Default-Risk

Overview

This project aims to predict the repayment abilities of potential borrowers using various machine learning techniques. We utilize multiple data sources, including credit bureau data, application histories, and more, to predict whether applicants will likely default on their loans. The primary focus is using tree-based models such as CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM to handle categorical features and efficiently process large datasets.
